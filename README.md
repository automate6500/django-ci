# 01_05 Challenge: Build a CI Workflow for a Python Project

In this challenge, you’ll create a **continuous integration (CI) workflow** for a Django application using **GitHub Actions**. You’ll start from a brand-new repository, add the project files, configure a starter workflow, and debug a failing build until the workflow completes successfully.

By the end of this challenge, you’ll have hands-on experience using GitHub Actions starter workflows, updating workflow configurations, and diagnosing common CI failures.

## Challenge tasks

To complete this challenge, you will:

- Create a new GitHub repository for a Django project
- Upload project files while preserving directory structure
- Configure a Django CI workflow using a starter template
- Update Python versions and GitHub Action versions
- Observe, diagnose, and fix a failing workflow
- Trigger and verify a successful CI run
